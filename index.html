        <p>BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.
            
        They launched in 2013 and have since rocketed to global stardom. Over the years, the group have produced material around various themes starting with the 'School' trilogy.BTS's music is also a success because of the subject of their music. While many K-pop songs are about relationships and love, BTS covers subjects that other bands may not like bullying, elitism, and mental health. Their ability to be relatable, humble while still being entertaining is rare.These 7 young men are really talented and they are divided in 2 groups, rappers (Suga, J-Hope and RM) and vocalists (Jin, Jimin, V and Jungkook). There are also the main dancers (J-Hope, Jungkook, Jimin and V). These 7 peeps have their own talents and are really unique.
        
        BTS has a total of 230 songs that contains 155 songs on 9 studio albums and one on the soundtrack album, also 2 reissues, and 2 compilation albums.BTS has released nine studio albums (one of which was reissued under a different title), six compilation albums, and six extended plays.. 
        
        
        They got recognition overseas during 'Boy In Luv' in 2014 and gained fans there after and then their fame was finally felt when they won 1st place at a music show for 'I Need U' on May 5, 2015. If you think about the time they actually went big, I would say it is during 'I Need U' in 2015 No list would be complete without 'Dynamite' – the group's first Hot 100 topper. And, not to mention, a commercial popular music favourite.</p>
